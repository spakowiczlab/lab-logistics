# Introduction 

The goal of this document is to summarize Spakowicz lab personnel and training data.

Read in the spreadsheet where personnel data are maintained.

```{r}
x <- readxl::read_xlsx(file.path(paths$onedrive,
                                 "mentee-list.xlsx"),
                       na = "NA")

x <-  readxl::read_xlsx("/Users/spak01/OneDrive - The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center/BuckeyeBox Data/osu/personnel/mentee-list.xlsx")
